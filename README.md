# Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) Digital Forensic Portal

A professional conceptual framework platform for the management and discovery of electronically stored information (ESI).

## Project Overview

This repository contains a specialized website dedicated to the Electronic Discovery Reference Model. It is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for legal and forensic professionals seeking to understand the structured stages of digital discovery. The platform utilizes a Brutalist design aesthetic to emphasize clarity, raw technical structure, and professional authority.

## Technical Specifications

- **Architecture**: Static HTML5 and CSS3.
- **Design Paradigm**: Brutalist (High contrast, monospace typography, bold spatial divisions).
- **Typography**: Courier New (Monospace) for technical authenticity.
- **Constraints**: Professional writing style with strict adherence to the exclusion of emojis and specialized punctuation markers such as double hyphens.

## Content Structure

The portal is organized into nine core stages of the EDRM process:

1. **Information Governance**: Strategies for data lifecycle management.
2. **Identification**: Scoping potential evidentiary sources.
3. **Preservation**: Legal hold implementation and data protection.
4. **Collection**: Forensically sound acquisition of ESI.
5. **Processing**: Deduplication and data normalization.
6. **Review**: Relevance assessment and legal privilege logging.
7. **Analysis**: Visualizing patterns and communication networks.
8. **Production**: Delivery of evidence in court mandated formats.
9. **Presentation**: Strategic use of digital exhibits in legal proceedings.
