            <h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
            <p>Analysis provides the intellectual framework for understanding the facts of a legal matter. While Review focuses on individual documents, Analysis focuses on the entire data set to reveal patterns, timelines, and relationships.</p>
            
            <p>This stage occurs throughout the discovery process but becomes more refined as the data set is narrowed down. Forensic analysts use specialized tools to visualize communication networks, perform sentiment analysis on text, and map out chronological events. This helps legal teams develop their case strategy and identify the "smoking gun" or key evidence that will be central to their arguments.</p>
            
            <p>Key methodologies in analysis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Social Network Analysis: Mapping connections between individuals.</li>
                <li>Content Clustering: Grouping documents with similar themes or concepts.</li>
                <li>Timeline Generation: Organizing events chronologically based on metadata.</li>
                <li>Domain Analysis: Identifying the primary sources and recipients of information.</li>
            </ul>
