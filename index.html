            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) serves as a conceptual framework for the electronic discovery process. It provides a standard for organizations to manage electronic data during investigations and litigation. This model outlines the essential stages from data creation to final presentation in a formal setting.</p>
