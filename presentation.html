            <h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
            <p>Presentation is the final stage of the EDRM, where the electronic information is used as evidence in a deposition, hearing, or trial. The goal is to communicate the facts clearly and persuasively to the trier of fact.</p>
            
            <p>In modern courtrooms, digital exhibits are standard. Legal teams use trial presentation software to highlight key passages of documents, play video depositions, and display forensic visualizations. The authenticity of the evidence must be established, often through expert testimony that explains how the data was collected and maintained. Proper presentation bridges the gap between technical data and legal proof.</p>
            
            <p>Key aspects of presentation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Selecting the most impactful exhibits for the jury.</li>
                <li>Ensuring technical compatibility with courtroom hardware.</li>
                <li>Preparing expert witnesses to testify on data integrity.</li>
                <li>Strategic use of multimedia to simplify complex technical concepts.</li>
            </ul>
