            <h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
            <p>Processing involves preparing the collected ESI for review by legal teams. This stage uses automated tools to reduce the sheer volume of data and extract relevant information into a searchable format.</p>
            
            <p>During processing, software identifies and removes exact duplicates through a process called deduplication. It also filters out system files that have no evidentiary value, often using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) list as a reference. The remaining data is then indexed, and metadata is extracted to allow for rapid searching and organization within a review platform.</p>
            
            <p>Core processing tasks include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for non searchable document images.</li>
                <li>Expansion of compressed archives and container files.</li>
                <li>Extraction of hidden metadata and embedded objects.</li>
                <li>Normalization of various file formats into a unified viewing standard.</li>
            </ul>
