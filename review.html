            <h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
            <p>The Review stage is often the most expensive and time consuming phase of the EDRM. It involves legal professionals examining the processed data to determine its relevance to the case and whether it is protected by legal privilege.</p>
            
            <p>Modern review processes utilize sophisticated technology to manage large data sets. Technology Assisted Review (TAR) and predictive coding use machine learning algorithms to prioritize documents based on relevance, significantly reducing the manual effort required. Reviewers must tag documents for various categories, such as "Responsive", "Not Responsive", or "Privileged". Any privileged data must be identified and cataloged in a privilege log to explain why it is being withheld from production.</p>
            
            <p>Techniques for efficient review:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Email Threading: Grouping related emails to avoid repetitive review.</li>
                <li>Redaction: Obscuring sensitive or privileged information within a document.</li>
                <li>Batching: Distributing document sets to multiple reviewers for parallel processing.</li>
                <li>Quality Control: Auditing a percentage of reviewed documents to ensure accuracy.</li>
            </ul>
